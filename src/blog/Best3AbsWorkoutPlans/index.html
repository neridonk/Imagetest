      <p class="lead">
        In planning for your abs workout, it is very important that you know your own strategies to get out there. Just like any other types of exercise that you do, abs workout should always start with warm-up for at least 5-10 minutes.
        Warming up can help you to prevent strains or injuries during your training. It’s especially very important before doing your abs exercise since most core workouts put stress at your lower back. Furthermore, warm-up exercise can help you to begin your ab workouts more effectively.
        In addition, when you are planning for your abs workout, make sure that you always take some time for stretching muscles right after your workout. That can help you to improve the flexibility and strength of your muscles. Once you do that regularly, as part of your daily routine, you can do the complete range motion much easier. It’s also a part in preparation for your next workout.
